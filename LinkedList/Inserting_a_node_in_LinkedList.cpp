/* Codestudio  Submission    (Insert Node At The Beginning) */

/* Problem Statement: You are given the head of a linked list 'ist' of size 'n' and an integer 'new Value" Your task is to 
insert a node with the value 'new Value' at the beginning of the 'list' and return the new head of the linked list. 
You must write an algorithm whose time complexity is O(1) and whose space complexity is O(1). */
