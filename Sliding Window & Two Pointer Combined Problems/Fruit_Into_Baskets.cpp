/* Codestudio  Submission    (Fruits and Baskets) */

/* Problem Statement: There are 'n' fruit trees that are planted along a road. The trees are numbered from 0 to n-1.
The type of fruit each tree bears is represented by an integer from 1 to 'n'. A Ninja is walking along that road.
He has two baskets and wants to put the maximum number of fruits in them. The restriction is that each basket can
have only one type of fruit. Ninja can start with any tree and end at any tree, but once he has started, he cannot
skip a tree i.e if he picks fruit from the tree , then he has to pick fruit from tree 'i+ 1' before going to the tree
'ยก+2' He will pick one fruit from each tree until he cannot, ie, he will stop when he has to pick a fruit of the third
type because only two different fruits can fill both baskets You are given an array 'arr. The 'i'th integer in this array
represents the type of fruit tree 'i* bears. Return the maximum number of fruits Ninja can put in both baskets after
satisfying all the conditions. */

/* The problem is the same as finding the maximum length of the substring that has at most two different elements. */

/* Solution 1: Brute Force */
// Time Complexity: O(N * N)
// Space Complexity: O(c)           Where 'n' is the number of fruit trees and 'c' is constant.

// int findMaxFruits(vector<int> &arr, int n) {
//     int maxFruits = 0;
//     for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
//         unordered_map<int, int> mp;             // num, count
//         // Finding maximum length of substring start from 'i' and having atmost 2
//         // distinct characters.
//         for(int j = i; j < n; j++){
//             mp[arr[j]]++;
//             if(mp.size() > 2){
//                 break;
//             }

//             maxFruits = max(maxFruits, j - i + 1);
//         }
//     }

//     return maxFruits;
// }

/* Solution 2: Two Pointer (Sliding Window) */
// Time Complexity: O(N)
// Space Complexity: O(c)           Where 'n' is the number of fruit trees and 'c' is constant.

// int findMaxFruits(vector<int> &arr, int n) {
//     // Contain unique elements in the current window mapped with their frequency in that window
//     unordered_map<int, int> mp;             // num, count
//     int left = 0, right = 0;
//     int maxFruits = 0;
//     while(right < n){
//         mp[arr[right]]++;
//         while(mp.size() > 2){
//             mp[arr[left]]--;
//             if(mp[arr[left]] == 0){
//                 mp.erase(arr[left]);
//             }
//             left++;
//         }

//         maxFruits = max(maxFruits, right - left + 1);

/* Leetcode  Submission    (904. Fruit Into Baskets) */

/* Problem Statement: You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick. */
